				<h2 id="problem-and-solution-overview">Problem and Solution Overview</h2>
				<p>Most of us want to help others and do good. It’s the reason why we donate to charities. However, our impact is ultimately limited by a) a lack of knowledge around how to give effectively, b) a lack of awareness around the impact of our donations, both large and small, and c) a lack of creative, effective channels to give that we can immediately access. The goal of Effective Giving is to create an app that provides information and resources necessary for making impactful donations. Our app aggregates established research on effective altruism and provides channels to facilitate the giving process to effective charities. By providing an information hub, the Effective Giving app will not only increase the amount of donations toward effective charities, but will also promote collaboration among users in the giving process.</p>

				<h3 id="goals-stakeholders-and-participants">Goals, Stakeholders, and Participants</h3>
				<p>We decided to conduct interviews and contextual inquiries with potential users from three different demographic groups: members of religious groups, members of charitable organizations, and effective altruists. The goals of our research included:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Understanding the thought process behind the charitable actions of members of each demographic group</li>
					<li>Identifying barriers to regular effective giving</li>
					<li>Identifying barriers to collaboration and discussion in the effective giving process</li>
				</ul>
