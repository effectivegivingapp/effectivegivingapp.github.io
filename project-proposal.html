				<h2>The Problem</h2>
				<p>Most of us want to help others and do good. It’s the reason why we donate to charities. However, our impact is ultimately limited by a) a lack of knowledge around how to give effectively, b) a lack of awareness around the impact of our donations, both large and small, and c) a lack of creative, effective channels to give that we can immediately access.</p>
				<h2>Informed Giving</h2>
				<p>The importance of proper research in the donation process cannot be understated. Consider the cautionary tale of <a href="http://effective-altruism.com/ea/3i/an_example_of_dogooding_done_wrong/">Playpumps International</a>. The nonprofit visited developing-world villages and installed merry-go rounds that pumped water when children played on them. Instead of using the traditional hand pump, villagers could use the playpump to get clean water and children could enjoy their first playground amenity.</p>
				<p>While the idea seemed brilliant, the results were disastrous. Children would understandably get tired of riding on the playpump, leaving villagers forced to constantly spin the pumps in order to access clean water. Moreover, the pumps were significantly more expensive and much less effective to use than the traditional hand pump. Millions of dollars were donated to Playpumps International, all toward an organization that unknowingly did more harm than good.</p>
				<h2>Impactful Giving</h2>
				<p>Our inability to conceive of the impact our donations can have also hinders charitable giving. However, when channeled into effective charities, <a href="https://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/learn-more/common-objections-to-giving">even small donations can save lives </a>. Consider the fact that members of the <a href="https://www.againstmalaria.com/">Against Malaria Foundation</a> only need $2.50 to buy an anti-mosquito bed net that can protect someone from malaria for three to four years on average.</p>
				<h2>Efficient Giving</h2>
				<p>A lack of convenient options also acts as a barrier to donating. Many apps exist for us to find the best restaurants (Yelp), places to stay (TripAdvisor), or movies to watch (Rotten Tomatoes). However, relatively few resources exist to help us donate effectively and efficiently. Searching the word “charity” returns no results in the App Store.</p>
				<h2> The Project </h2>
				<p>The project would build off of current research on effective altruism in order to allow users to make informed donations. For example, the product could provide well-researched profile pages on charities organized by cause. In addition, the product should provide mechanisms that constantly renew motivation to give, such as notifications that let the user know when and how their donation was used to help someone in need. Finally, the product should be built so that it can be easily integrated into existing user habits. For example, an app that allows Williams students to donate their meal swipes would be more effective than one that would require them to donate via a credit card transaction. </p>
