title: Contextual Inquiry
subtitle: Effective Altruism student organization officers at group meeting

## Context and Background
The Effective Altruism at Williams student organization is similarly interested
in the subject of partaking in charitable activity in an efficient manner.
This contextual inquiry was intended to understand the extent to and situations
under which effective altruists engage in charitable activity, as well as the
processes by which they determine what activities to involve themselves in.

The goal of the Effective Altruism club at Williams is to provide a forum for students
to discuss how to maximize their impact in the world through charitable giving,
ethical career paths, and self-improvement. The group also aims to raise and donate
money to effective charities. Vincent Gudenus, a current sophomore, leads the
student group, and numbers of club members and students frequently attend Sunday meetings.

## Methods
We attended the Effective Altruism general and board meetings on Sunday, 25
February. Both meetings were held in Paresky 112, one of the Paresky conference
rooms, with the board meeting held directly following the general meeting held
at 6-7 pm. Both meetings were in roughly round-table format. The general
meeting was open and announced to subscribers of the Effective Altruism mailing
list, while attendance at the board meeting was restricted to officers of the
EA student group.

During the general meeting, we took notes without substantially interfering or
participating in the meeting. We were able to attend the subsequent board
meeting at 7 pm, whereupon we raised questions brought up by our observations
in the general meeting.

Due to scheduling constraints, we had different project group members attend
the general and board meetings, to ensure that the inquiry proper was not
carried out by someone already familiar with the targeted participants.

## Results and Themes
Some themes we found among the observations we recorded for this inquiry:

- It is difficult for EAs to assess success for non-profit organizations. In
  particular, since non-profits often have abstract goals, effectiveness is
  difficult to quantify.
- EAs gather information about charity effectiveness largely from publications.

- Similar to investments, charities are regarded as having a level of risk
  which encourages diversification among charities
- A key goal is to diversify the donor base by increasing the accessibility of
  charity, so as to "get the ball rolling" with attendant benefits to marketing
  (i.e. due to peer effects)
- Most donors donate to single or very few causes

- Potential donors need to feel good about their contribution
- Unease arises when charities donated to have no immediate, practical impact
- Donors are better satisfied by giving directly than to meta-causes
- Some friction in the donation process may trigger feelings of accomplishment
  which might be lost were the process made easy
- EAs believe that typical donors don't want to think about their donations,
  and are uninterested in optimizing their donations vs. just giving one

We notice that there's a lot of complexity involved in the process of deciding
how and to what causes to donate to, especially arising from the difficulty of
finding accurate information evaluating non-profit organizations.

We find that a key motivating factor in making donations is a resultant sense
of satisfaction for having performed a charitable act, without necessarily
wanting to put much thought into the process.
