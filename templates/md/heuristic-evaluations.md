title: Heuristic Evaluations

We obtained three heuristic evaluations. We broke up into two groups:
- Mia and Tiffany (our team members) and Grace Mazzarella (from A2A group)
- Michael (our team member), David Ariyibi and Diego Gonzalez (From Sous Shopper group)

There are a few adjustments that we need to make to our paper prototype according to the feedback we got from the heuristic evaluations:
- Move the search bar on the home page from the bottom to the top (more intuitive and adheres to existing standards)
- Add a done button after payment confirmation screen to give the user a feel of a safe exit
- Store card information for users that use the same card all the time
- Add a distinct back button so that users can return to previous screen 
- The ability to retroactively change donation patterns for charities
- Reconsider the position of the donate button so that users can avoid scrolling through information
- "Top" charities is ambiguous and users may have no idea what it means
