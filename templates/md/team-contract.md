## Our Values

### Fun and Work & Life Balance

We create a positive environment where we can enjoy working and spending time together.

We recognize and appreciate when someone has given their best effort and contributed to the team.

We respect each other’s health and time constraints - sleep well, eat well!

### Participation
We play an active role in making decisions and taking on tasks.

We get individual tasks completed on time, and to ask for help when needed

We take on tasks according to strengths and preferences, with each member getting opportunity to perform diverse roles.

We are open to each other’s ideas and new approaches.

### Communication, Active Listening, and Constructive Criticism
We refrain from blaming and shutting down ideas, but rather focus on problem solving and doing what is most in line with the project’s goals and purpose

We meet and communicate frequently to discuss project tasks, and respond to each other within 6-12 hours

If one teammate is having an issue with another teammate, we talk directly to them about the issue. No gossiping.

In discussions, everyone is focused and listening to whomever is speaking.  Distractions are not acceptable (i.e. phones, other homework, web surfing etc.).   

### Collaborative Problem Solving

We make decisions as a team within set deadlines.

We take each other’s solutions into consideration and build on each other’s ideas.

We keep each member informed and part of the decision making process

### Consistent Preparation

We review each other’s work before team meetings so we are ready to give constructive, thoughtful input.

We arrive on time to meetings or communicate when there’s a conflict at least 6 hours prior.

### Conflict Handling
We actively listen and understand each other’s perspectives.

We resolve conflicts appropriately and maturely.

Conflicts are valuable lessons and opportunities to strengthen the team.

We find common ground.

We don't judge.

### Logistics

Friday Lunch meetings 12:15-1pm at Lee's Snack Bar.

Set and send out the agenda beforehand (i.e a list of things we want to discuss).

From there, we divide up tasks.

4 PM check-ins on weekdays in the GroupMe summarizing a) what we got done since last check in, b) what we want to do before next check in, and c) things that we need to be effective.

More meetings if necessary can be scheduled in as determined by the group

### Rewards and Punishments

We want to make something to celebrate! Rewards include grabbing dinner to celebrate wins, snack bar, spring street market lunch - the list goes on!

However, if a teammate isn’t meeting team expectations and guidelines or their work does not demonstrate 100% effort, we should coordinate a team meeting to bring up and discuss the issue
